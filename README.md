# Data-Structures-and-Programming-FEIT

*Course goals:* Introduction to data structures, classes and instance of objects. Upon completion, the student will be able to solve programming problems with the help of object-oriented programming in C ++, such as: creating classes, objects, overloading operators, virtual functions, inheritance.

*Syllabus:* Introduction to a new type of data. Complex data types. Defining structures. Defining, using and compiling self-made header files. Automating the compiling process using the tool make and Makefile. Introduction to C++. Concepts of programming in C++. Structures in C++. References and pointers in C++. Functions and overload of functions. Concepts of object oriented programming. Class and objects concepts. Constructor and destructor. New data structures. Concepts od stack and queue data types. Friendly classes and functions. Functions members of a class. Overloading operators (functions) members of a class. Single linked lists. Double linked lists – concept. Double linked lists in C++. Dynamic memory allocation. Inheritance concepts. Polymorphism concepts. Generalisation of classes. Virtual functions. Abstract classes.
